# LBAAS Frontend Plugin

Welcome to the lbaas-frontend plugin!

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you can:

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start`

This will launch the Backstage app and you should be able to find your plugin under `/lbaas`.

## Development

To run the plugin in isolation, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn workspace @internal/plugin-lbaas-frontend start
```

This will start a development server that serves only the plugin, which can be faster for iteration.
